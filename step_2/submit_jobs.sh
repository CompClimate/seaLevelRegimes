# Runs for all parameters and for 50 ensembles for each param combinations
# This script submits jobs to a SLURM scheduler for running the `run_cluster.sh` script with various parameters.
# It uses a nested loop to iterate through different combinations of ensemble size, UMAP minimum distances, UMAP NN values, and number of clusters.
# The script is designed to be run on a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster.

# Define variables for the script
# Supported by UC Davis SLURM scheduler 
ENSEMBLES=(0 5 10 15) # Define the ensemble numbers default to 5 members per ensemble block (can be adjusted as needed). Only if you have enough memory
# ENSEMBLES=(0 5) # For memebers 1 to 10
# ENSEMBLES=(15) # For memebers 16 to 20
UMAP_MDS=(0.1 0.3 0.5 0.7 0.9) # Define the minimum distances (can be adjusted as needed)

# NUM_CLUSTS=(3 10) # To run non completed clusterings

# Seem too large for the job requirements.
